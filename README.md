## Personal Note
During the journey of building and running iTopper, I made a life-changing decision in my junior year of high school. As a student in class 11th, I was deeply passionate about the idea behind iTopper and its potential to make a positive impact on JEE & NEET aspirants' lives.

However, the financial constraints of being from a below-middle-class background posed a significant challenge. I had to make a difficult choice between continuing my senior secondary schooling and investing in the iTopper. Believing in the vision I had for the platform, I took a leap of faith and decided to quit school to dedicate my time and limited resources to iTopper.

This decision to pour my heart, soul, and what little money I had into iTopper turned out to be the best decision I ever made in my life. It was a journey full of ups and downs, facing obstacles I had never anticipated. Despite the difficulties, the experience of being an entrepreneur at such a young age taught me invaluable lessons in perseverance, resourcefulness, and determination.

While iTopper's path may not have led to the commercial success I hoped for, I don't regret a single moment. The passion, the drive, and the dedication poured into the project have shaped me into the person I am today.
